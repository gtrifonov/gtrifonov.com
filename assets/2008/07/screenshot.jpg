For those who are not familiar with Terrarium, I’ll provide a little history. It is a game that was created by members of the .NET Framework team in the .NET Framework 1.0 timeframe and used initially as an internal test application. At various conferences and online chats, Terrarium provided a way for developers to learn about the new .NET programming model and language. By making the source code for .NET Terrarium 2.0 available, we hope to provide a fun and interesting opportunity for developers to try out and learn the latest advances in the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Bil Simser, a Microsoft MVP, who brought the interest in Terrarium to our attention, volunteered to help coordinate the project, and patiently waited while we prepared to release the source code.  Read Bil&#8217;s blog post on how it works, what&#8217;s changed, and what the future holds for this ever-evolving project.</p>
<p>Well, I have to say, that even as a developer on the Terrarium, I&#8217;ve chosen to taken a long hiatus away from the world of creature coding, setting up insanely difficult to maintain servers, and battling the grid based movement system.  But not everyone felt the same way I did about the project and it has continued to move forward with time.  As a matter of fact, some people may have seen some of the graphics updates at the PDC, and still others might currently be running the latest client built for the .NET Framework V1.1.</p>
<p>With all these latest enhancements I&#8217;m willing to jump back into the foray.  I&#8217;m sure they could definitely use some extra peers to extend the current EcoSystem.  The Terrarium Farm is back up over at WindowsForms.NET with some new and helpful code, you can grab the latest client, and maybe particpate on the forums a bit.</p>
<p>So where do I stand as things move forward?  Well, I think I&#8217;m going to jump in and try to help out with the source code release, so everyone can see what a great coding demonstration the Terrarium really is.  I also have some goodies in the form of a peer based community site for the Terrarium and a new version of the Terrarium Server that is insanely easy to get up and running.  So if you were ever intersted in the project, I think now is a good time to revisit any ties you might have and get yourself back up to speed for the public source code release.  Time to have some fun!</p>
<p>Bil Simser has just done the .NET Community a huge solid. Bil has dug up and re-released Terrarium to CodePlex wtih the intent to update it to use new language features and new usability features like ClickOnce.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re newish to the .NET Community (&lt;3-5 years?) you might not have heard of Terrarium. There was a time when it was the<strong> </strong>tool for getting newbies excited about learning .NET. I showed dozens of high-school and college students how to <a href="http://usedgolfclubsforsale.net/callaway-pre-owned/callaway-drivers/">callaway preowned</a> program using Terrarium. Back at my last company one of our engineers did brown bag lunches on good bug design and ran a Terrarium Server internally.</p>
<p>Terrarium hasn&#8217;t been even looked at by the Microsoft SDK team in two years, as live happens, you know. Bil hunted them down, did a bunch of paperwork and it&#8217;s back. You can check out <a href="http://55inchledtv.com">55 led tv</a> the source or download the release.</p>
<p>You can run it alone, just a world in a box, or you can hook it up to a server and that&#8217;s where it gets interesting, as your bugs all live in a connected world.</p>
<p>Your animals have Idle (event-based) loops that you can react to, and who amongst us hasn&#8217;t wanted to write these lines of code at least once?</p>
<div id="_mcePaste">// Reproduce as often as possible</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">if (CanReproduce)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">BeginReproduction(null);</div>
<p>// Reproduce as often as possible <a href="http://groutsteamcleaner.com/">grout steam cleaner</a> / if (CanReproduce)  BeginReproduction(null);</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'segoe ui', tahoma, verdana, 'lucida grande', 'lucida sans unicode', sans-serif; line-height: 18px;">Now you have the chance.</span></p>
<p>A great lunchtime project is to get a bunch of the <a href="http://dealingwithanxiety.us/">dealing with anxiety</a> nerds from your company in a room, teach them Terrarium and have a battle!</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m a lover, not a fighter, so I run away when attacked.</p>
<p>private void MyAnimal_Attacked(object sender, AttackedEventArgs e)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>if (e.Attacker.IsAlive)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>AnimalState TheAttacker = e.Attacker;</p>
<p>BeginDefending(TheAttacker); //defend against the attacker</p>
<p>WriteTrace(&#8220;Run away to some random point&#8221;);</p>
<p>int X = OrganismRandom.Next(0, WorldWidth &#8211; 1);</p>
<p>int Y = OrganismRandom.Next(0, WorldHeight &#8211; 1);</p>
<p>BeginMoving(new MovementVector(new Point(X, Y), 10));</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Go check out the release of Terrarium and download the app, SDK and server. There will be more to come on Bil&#8217;s Blog, I&#8217;m sure. He&#8217;ll also be running a public Terrarium Server.  It&#8217;s exciting to see this blast from the past. Now I think it&#8217;s time for me to visit a local High School Computer Science class again some lunchtime&#8230;</p>
<p>One of the things I think will be interesting to see, is if folks come up <a href="http://bestbluray.org/">best blu-ray player</a> with better patterns for managing state within these animals. Many Terrarium animals end up with Idle loops that look like Arrow Code.</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>do something</p>
<p>endif</p>
<p>endif</p>
<p>endif</p>
<p>endif</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t nice to look at, and it would promote bad habits if it was the first kind of code someone new to programming ever saw.</p>
<p>The world has changed since this was released in 2002. The race is on and now I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Who will write the first aesthetically pleasing (from a code perspective) Terrarium Animal?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The first F# Terrarium animal?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The first Ruby (DLR) Terrarium animal?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Boo? Nemerle? IronPython?</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Microsoft Sans Serif', Arial, Geneva, sans-serif; line-height: normal; color: #30332d;">The Windows SDK team evolved the game in the .NET Framework 2.0 timeframe, but we haven&#8217;t worked on it for over two years. As a result, the source code for Terrarium 2.0 doesn’t use the very latest .NET technologies. By making the source code available, we hope to provide a fun and interesting opportunity to learn about and use the latest advances in the .NET Framework.</span></p>
<p>In Terrarium, you can create herbivores, carnivores, or plants and then introduce them into a peer-to-peer, networked ecosystem where they complete for survival. Terrarium demonstrates some of the features of the .NET Framework, including Windows Forms integration with DirectX®; XML Web services; support for peer-to-peer networking; support for multiple programming languages; <a href="http://un55c6500.us">un55c6500</a> the capability to update smart client, or Windows-based, applications via a remote Web server; and the evidence-based and code access security infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Project Coordination</strong></p>
<p>Bil Simser, a Microsoft MVP, has volunteered to coordinate this project. Thanks, Bil!</p>
<p><strong>Game overview</strong></p>
<p>The game can run in two modes:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 0em; padding-left: 2em; list-style-type: none; list-style-image: url(http://i2.codeplex.com/Images/v17091/doublearrow.gif);">
<li style="margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-top: 0.3em; vertical-align: middle;">Terrarium Mode – 1) The user may run alone, without peers. In this case, the ecosystem presented on the screen represents the whole of the ecosystem. This is good <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/skin-cancer-pictures">skin cancer pictures</a> for creature testing purposes. 2) The user may also elect to join with a select group of peers, expanding the ecosystem across all of the participating peer computers. This is simple to do. Each participating user opts into a special, private network by entering an agreed upon character string in the “channel” textbox on the <a href="http://un55c6300.info/">un55c6300</a> Terrarium console. Upon entering that string, the user’s computer is matched with only those computers which also entered that same string.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-top: 0.3em; vertical-align: middle;">Ecosystem Mode – This is the standard mode, in which the user’s computer runs just a small slice of an ecosystem which spans all of the participating peer computers, worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both modes, you can develop your own creatures or you can watch as other developers’ creatures battle it out for survival by <a href="http://camerasonsale.net/kodak/kodak-playsport-features-and-reviews/">kodak playsport</a> running Terrarium as a standalone application or as a screensaver.</p>
<p>When creating a creature, you have control over everything from genetic traits (eyesight, speed, defensive power, attacking power, etc.) to behavior (the algorithms for locating prey, moving, attacking, etc.) to reproduction (how often a creature will give birth and what “genetic information,” if any, will be <a href="http://sdhcmemorycard.net/">sdhc memory card</a> passed on to its offspring). Upon completing the development process, the code is compiled into an assembly (dynamically linked library, or DLL) that can be loaded into the local ecosystem slice, <a href="http://howtowhitenteethathome.us/">whiten teeth at home</a> viewable through the Terrarium console. When a creature is initially introduced in Ecosystem Mode, ten instances  of it are scattered throughout the local ecosystem. No more instances of that creature may be introduced by that user or any other on the network until the creature has died off completely. By contrast, if running in Terrarium Mode, an infinite number of instances of a given creature may be entered into the environment.</p>
<p>Once the creature is loaded into Terrarium, it acts on the instructions supplied by its code. Each creature is granted between 2 and 5 milliseconds (depending on the speed of the machine) to act before it is destroyed <a href="http://treasurechestscrapbooks.com/">scrapbook supplies</a>. This prevents any one creature from hogging the processor and halting the game.</p>
<p>Within each peer in the network, a blue “teleporter” ball rolls randomly about. If the user is running with active peers logged in (either in Ecosystem Mode or using a private channel in Terrarium Mode), whenever this blue ball rolls over a creature, that creature is transported to a randomly selected peer machine.</p>
<p>For more details on how Terrarium works, see the information provided in the \Server\Website\Documentation directory of this project.</p>
