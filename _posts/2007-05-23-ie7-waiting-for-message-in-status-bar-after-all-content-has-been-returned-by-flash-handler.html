            <p>Today I have very interesting bug related to status bar message&#xA0;&#xA0;in IE7. On pages I has three flash &lt;object&gt; tags with src pointing to web handler. Handler is&#xA0;returning flash&#xA0;binary data to be displayed with Response.BinaryWrite . But even after all flash movies have been displayed IE7 was stucked with message in status bar &#x201D; Waiting for http:// xyz&#xA0;&#xA0; 3 items remains&#x201D;. In FireFox same page working as designed.&#xA0;</p>
<p>First I thought that something wrong with object tag or how I called handler. To my suprise problem was solved when I move all code from handler to empty aspx page. The difference in responce output was only in empty doctype,body ,html tags after binary data in responce.</p>
<p>I get one more step and move back all code to handler and add doctype code. Ha! it still working.</p>
<p>Finally I ended with just empty string insertion.</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">context.Response.BinaryWrite(data);<br>context.Response.Write(&#x201D; &#x201C;); <br>context.Response.End();</font></p>
