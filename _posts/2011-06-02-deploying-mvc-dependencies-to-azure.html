            <p>If you creating web application to be deployed to Windows Azure, you probably noticed that deployment and azure instance initialization may take a while. Any missing reference or break will cause you time and lost productivity.</p>
<p>Few days ago I spent couple of hours trying to include all mvc references one by one making sure that application app has minimum set of required assemblies.</p>
<p>Phil hack published an article <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2011/05/25/bin-deploying-asp-net-mvc-3.aspx</a> regarding how to include MVC,Razor dependencies into your deployment.</p>
<p>By default Azure instance will not have required packages installed. So you need to make sure that all files will be located in your bin folder. </p>
<p>&#x201C;If your server doesn&#x2019;t have ASP.NET MVC 3 installed, you&#x2019;ll need to make sure the following set of assemblies are deployed in the bin folder of your web application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.dll </li>
<li>System.Web.Helpers.dll </li>
<li>System.Web.Mvc.dll </li>
<li>System.Web.Razor.dll </li>
<li>System.Web.WebPages.Deployment.dll </li>
<li>System.Web.WebPages.dll </li>
<li>System.Web.WebPages.Razor.dll </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x201D;</p>
<p>Simply right click on your project to add deployable dependencies.</p>

<p>For other GAC assemblies which are not part of .net 4.0 framework make sure to set Copy Local flag to true:</p>
