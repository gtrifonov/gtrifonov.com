<blockquote><p>One of the biggest, constant problems we&#x2019;ve seen our enterprise customers deal with and we here at Microsoft have to also contend with is that of the XSS (Cross Site Scripting) bug.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s very common and unfortunately, still an issue we have to deal with in many web applications.&#xA0; Internally, the ACE Team has been working on several projects to help <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=19a9e348-bdb9-45b3-a1b7-44ccdcb7cfbe&amp;displaylang=en&apos;, &apos;detect them in the code bases&apos;);">detect them in the code bases</a> that we review so that they can be fixed before going live.
</p><p>XSSDetect runs as a Visual Studio plug-in and can detect potential XSS issues in managed code.&#xA0;</p>
