            <p>I run few days into a problem when I was not able to delete local development storage tables using Windows Azure API and system was throwing me exceptions. The reason of these exceptions I guess was the fact that table were very big.</p>
<p>In basic scenarios resetting can be archived with Storage emulator UI.&#xA0; </p>

<p>I tried this but my machine became unresponsive because due too DSService.exe and sql service.</p>

<p>Killing services left azure tables as they were before.</p>
<p>It turned out that you can also use %Azure SDK%\bin\devstore\dsinit.exe&#xA0; /forceCreate command , which worked perfectly for me.</p>
