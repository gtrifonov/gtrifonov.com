            <p>I had a weird problem with Office communicator trying to call regular phone numbers. I was not able to hear&#xA0; to whom I am calling and all set up sounds were working (indicating that hardware is working) when I was trying to configure headset. </p>
<p>The problem has been fixed by installing Desktop experience feature which enables Vista features such as Media Player on Windows Server 2008 machine.</p>
<p>Hope it will help you</p>
