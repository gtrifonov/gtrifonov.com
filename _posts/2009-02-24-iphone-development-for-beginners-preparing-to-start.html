            <p><img src="http://gtrifonov.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/overview_iphonetouch.jpg">     <br>Did I write a single line of code for IPhone ? &#x2013;No     <br>Do I have a coding experience for Mac ? &#x2013; No&#xA0; <br>Do I have IPhone ? &#x2013; No.     <br>Did I ever use Mac OS? &#x2013;No</p>
