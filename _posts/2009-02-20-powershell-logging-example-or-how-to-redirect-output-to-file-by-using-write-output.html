            <p>Few days I got a simple question from one of blog readers regarding how to log in powershell .</p>
<p>In order to redirect your output to file you need to execute script and indicate that output source is file</p>
<p>PS C:\&gt; prototypes\logging.ps1 |Out-File C:\prototypes\ps.log</p>
<p>In your script use command Write-Output to write anything to your current output &#x1F642;</p>
<p>Write-Output &#x201C;Test&#x201D;</p>
