            <p>I am periodically getting messages with contract and full time offers. I am very glad that my resume bring someone attention, but currently I am not looking for new employer. I am satisfied with what I am doing now and I hope that I will not looking for new job in nearest future. I am planning to remove resume from site or make it researchable. </p>
<p>Thank you for you job guys, it is very useful but now I prefer to settle down for a while.</p>
