<p>I found very useful notes about scrums in <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2007/04/02/beware-the-scrum-witch.aspx&apos;, &apos;Bil Simser&apos;);" title="Scrum witch">Bil Simser</a> post&#xA0; ( may be it came from our build brake stone idea&#xA0;: ). <br>Our team has build brake stone. We offer it to person who broke daily build (no matter debug or retail). <br>The author of this topic was the first owner of it :). After we configured ms build style daily builds our life become more quite during major checkins.&#xA0;&#xA0;Do you have little tricks to improve your daily productivity? Share please.  </p>
<p>&#x201C;The witch has been pretty successful as we&#x2019;re sticking closer to the routine and there&#x2019;s less gossip-talk during the scrum. Scrums end in under 10 minutes now (where they previously would linger for 15, 20 and even 30 minutes) and everyone is focused. I&#x2019;ve only had to activate the Witch twice, and both times were with the same PM who charged off asking all kinds of questions (not even related to the current sprint!).&#x201D;  </p>
<p>&#x201C;The daily scrum is your commitment to the team, not a report to the PM or Scrum Master on what you did. Be kind and respectful and the pain will last only a few minutes.&#x201D;</p>
