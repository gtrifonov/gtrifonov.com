            <p>Dear George, </p>
<p>We&#x2019;re writing to let you know about recent product updates available in Microsoft pubCenter. Through pubCenter you can now access the Advertising Exchange for Mobile, as well as user interface updates. If you&#x2019;re a Windows Phone 7 application developer, you can take advantage of the new ad exchange to help extend your reach. And all publishers can use our expanded blocking tools to improve your control of content. </p>
<p>Build on a new mobile platform </p>
<p>You can now create compelling ad-supported applications that are free for Windows Phone 7 users. The new Microsoft Advertising Exchange for Mobile is the first real-time, bid-based ad exchange designed to enable display ad serving for Windows Phone 7 applications. The ad exchange can help you:    <br>&#x2022;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Expand your audience.    <br>&#x2022;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Control the ads that are displayed on your website.    <br>&#x2022;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Access monetization data through mobile ad reporting.    <br>Building on this platform can help you to increase yield from transactions and reduce waste. This is because ad exchange allows you to offer mobile inventory to multiple networks that can then bid at the exact moment an ad impression is served. </p>
<p>Get started today: Sign in to pubCenter, click the Setup tab, and then click Overview. To learn more, see our Monetize your Windows Phone 7 Apps page. </p>
<p>Use the renamed &quot;Sites &amp; apps&quot; tab </p>
<p>The pubCenter Properties tab is now called Sites &amp; apps. This tab is where you manage your websites and applications, including new mobile applications. </p>
<p>Improve site visitor experience </p>
<p>With the latest upgrade to our blocking tools, you can:    <br>&#x2022;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Use the increased URL and keyword block-list size to better control which ads appear on your sites.    <br>&#x2022;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Perform targeted ad blocking to manage competitive exclusions and content that falls outside of your policies.    <br>&#x2022;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Take advantage of increased filter list limits and bulk import.    <br>Your success is important to us, and we&#x2019;re here to help. If you have any questions or need assistance, we encourage you to visit our Community or contact Support. </p>
<p>Thank you for using Microsoft pubCenter. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>The Microsoft pubCenter Team </p>
