            <p>Hello, welcome to my weblog.&#xA0;My name is &#xA0;George Trifonov. Previously I used my website only for internal tests&#xA0; and&#xA0;personal applications. Now it is almost 2 years since my site&#xA0;had &#x2018; under construction&#x2019; label.&#xA0;From the moment&#xA0;I joined Microsoft as contractor I decided to change my attitude to&#xA0;my public&#xA0;presence and start sharing my thoughts, news, articles about &#xA0;.net,asp.net,Ajax and my life.</p>
<p>In nearest weeks I am planning to publish several articles about blogging using Windows Live Writer and Meta Weblog API. I found very comfortable to post using this application which support customization and different blog&#x2019;s API. You can find a lot of information about this amazing tool by visiting <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/</a>&#xA0;.</p>
<p>So if you are interested how to build your own blog engine for Windows Live Writer subscribe to my blog. Aslo I want to write several articles about coding general items using low budget hosting plans like mine, which doesn&#x2019;t provide database access.</p>
