<h4>&#x201C;Introduction</h4>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in Web-based applications that fail to properly validate and/or encode input that is embedded in response data. Malicious users can then inject client-side script into response data causing the unsuspecting user&#x2019;s browser to execute the script code. The script code will appear to have originated from a trusted-site and may be able to bypass browser protection mechanisms such as security zones.
</p><p>These attacks are platform and browser independent, and can allow malicious users to perform malicious actions such as gaining unauthorized access to client data like cookies or hijacking sessions entirely.
</p><p>Simple steps that developers can take to prevent XSS attacks in their ASP.NET applications include (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/PAGHT000004.asp&apos;, &apos;How To: Prevent Cross-Site Scripting in ASP.NET&apos;);">How To: Prevent Cross-Site Scripting in ASP.NET</a> in the patterns &amp; practices series for more detail):
</p><ul>
<li>Validating and constraining input
</li><li>Encoding output</li>
</ul>
<p>For defence in depth, developers may wish to use the <strong>Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library</strong> to encode output. This library differs from most encoding libraries in that it uses the &#x201C;principle of inclusions&#x201D; technique to provide protection against XSS attacks. This approach works by first defining a valid or allowable set of characters, and encodes anything outside this set (invalid characters or potential attacks). The principle of inclusions approach provides a high degree of protection against XSS attacks and is suitable for Web applications with high security requirements.&#x201D;.</p>
