            <p>Got email few days ago from Apple: 	  iPhone SDK 3.2 beta is now available to all iPhone Developer Standard and Enterprise Program Members from the iPhone Dev Center.  Do you think that Apple prediction about golden rush for app developers will come true? App store for Iphoen is Apple success story, will we see something similar for Ipad?</p>
