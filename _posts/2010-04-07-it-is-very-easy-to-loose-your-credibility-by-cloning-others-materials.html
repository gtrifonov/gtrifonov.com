            <p>Software industry is&#xA0; small world so it is very easy to loose your credibility especially in developer community blogosphere. Today received an email from one of my readers that my article about <a href="http://gtrifonov.azurewebsites.net/blog/2006/11/27/Coding_blog_engine_with_MetaWeblog_API_support_and.aspx&apos;, &apos;MetaWeblog API&apos;);">MetaWeblog API</a>&#xA0; has been cloned by <strong>Deepak Kamboj, </strong>ASP.NET/C# Web Developer,Chandigarh, India. No references to original content or to real author. Deepak i don&#x2019;t think that cloning articles is a best approach to beef your blog. Hopefully you will find some time to research something by your own or at least put some efforts to improve code in article like many did since 2006.&#xA0; </p>
