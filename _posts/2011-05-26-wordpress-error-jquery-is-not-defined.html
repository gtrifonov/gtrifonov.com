            <p>After installing WordPress site and downloading plugins i noticed that half of admin functionality is not working.</p>
<p>I tried to search for solutions and did some debugging and here what i found.</p>
<p>Solution 1 (worked for me):<br>
1. In wp-config.php insert define(&#x2018;CONCATENATE_SCRIPTS&#x2019;, false ); at the beginning of file.Once you will add this your scripts requests will not be merged together, so you will be able to do investigation<br>
2. Open Firebug in FF or developer toolbar in IE (F12) or Tools-&gt;Developer Tools in Chrome to see outgoing requests<br>
3.Find request wp-includes/js/jqure.js<br>
4. In my case it was returning 403 error &#x2013; Forbidden<br>
5. Change permissions to files using chmod command :chmod -R 777 D:/home/site/wwwroot/wp-includes/js</p>
<p>Solution 2(reported to be working for various users in different posts):<br>
You have missing files in D:/home/site/wwwroot/wp-includes/js<br>
1. Download wp source code from wp site and unzip them<br>
2. Upload wp-includes/js folder to your site wp-includes/js folder via ftp</p>
<p>Solution 3:<br>
1.Disable all plugins<br>
2.Make sure that problemis fixed and start enabling plugins one at a time to isolate corrupted</p>
